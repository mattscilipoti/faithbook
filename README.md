FAItHBOOK!

Faithbook is a Christian social networking app. Kinda like Christian Mingle, but also like Facebook. Faithbook users
will be able to sign up, create profiles, add a photo, education history, and information about themselves. Users
will also have a "prayers" counter on their profile, the number of which fellow users can affect by sending prayers, kinda
like a measurement of popularity. Users will be able to leave comments on fellow users' profiles. Users can comment on their
own profiles as well, if they want to reply to a comment someone else left, or if they're crazy.

USER STORIES

As a user, I should be able to:
1. Sign up, sign in, and sign out, so I can create a profile, make changes to my profile, and make sure no one else is messin'
   with my profile info, respectively.
2. Add information to a profile, so people can see what my name is, what I look like, where I was educated, and more about me.
3. Add comments to all users' profiles, including my own, so I can keep in touch with all of my buddies.
4. Send and recieve "prayers" that increase the number of the prayer counters, so I know how many people are praying for me,
   and so I can let others know that they are being prayed for.
5. Edit the information I entered in my profile, so I can change typos and other mistakes.
6. See all users' profiles from the homepage, so I can navigate to them easily.
7. Have the option to delete my profile, so I can overcome my social networking addiction.
